## Description
A tic-tac-toe game that:

* Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
* Indicates when a player has won the game,
* Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
* Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.

## Ideas for improvements :

* For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.
* Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
* Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
* When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).
* Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.
